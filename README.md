# model-training

This repository contains the training pipeline for the sentiment analysis model used in our REMLA project. 

- It uses the [lib-ml](https://github.com/remla25-team21/lib-ml) library for data preprocessing and saves the trained model (`sentiment_model.pkl`) as a release artifact. 
- The training dataset can be found in `data/a1_RestaurantReviews_HistoricDump.tsv`.
